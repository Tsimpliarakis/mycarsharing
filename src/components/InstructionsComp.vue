      <div class="text-caption">
        Peer-to-peer car sharing involves individuals renting out their personal
        vehicles to others when they're not using them, often facilitated by
        online platforms or apps. Owners list their cars on the platform,
        specifying availability, location, and rental terms. Renters can then
        search for available cars in their area, book them for specific time
        periods, and use them for their needs. Owners earn money from renting
        out their cars, while renters gain access to vehicles without the
        commitment of ownership. This model increases vehicle utilization and
        can provide additional income for car owners.
